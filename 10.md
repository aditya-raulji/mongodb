# 1. Create the Database and Collections

- Letâ€™s start by creating a MongoDB database named codinggita and two collections: students and subjects. You will also create sub-collections for topics related to each subject. 
 
 ## Step 1: Create the Database

```jsx 
use codinggita  // Switch to the CodingGita database. If it doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it automatically.
```
## Step 2: Create the students collection
```jsx 
db.createCollection("students");
```

## Step 3: Create the subjects collection

```jsx 
db.createCollection("subjects");
```
- At this point, you have created a new database with two collections.


 ## Task 1: Add multiple students

 - Insert at least 5 students into the students collection with unique roll numbers, names, departments, years, and subjects enrolled.

  ```jsx 
      db.students.insertMany([
  {
    "name": "Aditya",
    "rollNumber": 1,
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "year": 2,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["NodeJS", "React", "MongoDB"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Krishna"
    "rollNumber": 2,
    "department": "Information Technology",
    "year": 3,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["React", "Angular"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Aksar",
    "rollNumber": 3,
    "department": "Electrical Engineering",
    "year": 1,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["Python", "Matlab"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Asvini",
    "rollNumber": 4,
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "year": 2,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["NodeJS", "React"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Jenil",
    "rollNumber": 5,
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "year": 1,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["NodeJS", "MongoDB"]
  }
    ]);
    ```

## Task 2: Add multiple subjects

   - Insert 4 subjects into the subjects collection, each with 3 to 5 topics.
```jsx
db.subjects.insertMany([
  {
    "name": "NodeJS",
    "topics": ["JavaScript Basics", "Express", "REST APIs"]
  },
  {
    "name": "React",
    "topics": ["JSX", "Components", "Hooks", "State Management"]
  },
  {
    "name": "MongoDB",
    "topics": ["Collections", "Indexes", "Aggregation", "CRUD"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Angular",
    "topics": ["Components", "Directives", "Services"]
  }
]);

```

## Task 3: Query students based on subject enrollment

- Query the students collection to find all students who are enrolled in NodeJS.

```jsx
db.students.find({subjectsEnrolled: "NodeJS"});
```

## Task 4: Add a new topic to a subject
- Add a new topic to the NodeJS subject.
```jsx
db.subjects.updateOne(
  { name: "NodeJS" },
   { $push: { topics: "Middleware" } }
);
```

## Task 5: Query subjects with multiple topics

- Query the subjects collection to find subjects that contain at least 4 topics.
``` jsx
db.subjects.find({ topics: { $size: { $gte: 4 } } });

```
 ## Task 6: Update student enrollment

- Add the subject "React Native" to Jenil's subjects.
``` jsx 
db.students.updateOne(
  { name: "Jenil" },
  { $push: { subjectsEnrolled: "React Native" } }
);

```
## Task 7: Query all students
- Query all students in the database and print out their names and enrolled subjects.

```jsx 
db.students.find({}, { name: 1, subjectsEnrolled: 1, _id: 0 });
```

## Task 8: Update multiple students' year

- Update the year for all students in the Computer Science department to year 3.
```jsx
db.students.updateMany(
  { department: "Computer Science" },
  { $set: { year: 3 } }
);
```

## Task 9: Add new topics to multiple subjects
- Add new topics to React, NodeJS, and MongoDB subjects. Ensure each subject gets at least one new topic.
``` jsx 
db.subjects.updateOne(
  { name: "React" },
  { $push: { topics: "Context API" } }
);

db.subjects.updateOne(
  { name: "NodeJS" },
  { $push: { topics: "Event Loop" } }
);

db.subjects.updateOne(
  { name: "MongoDB" },
  { $push: { topics: "Transactions" } }
);
```

## Task 10: Remove a topic from a subject

- Remove the topic "Express" from the NodeJS subject.
```jsx 
db.subjects.updateOne(
  { name: "NodeJS" },
  { $pull: { topics: "Express" } }
);

```
## Task 11: Query all students in a specific year

- Query and return all students in year 2 or year 3.

```jsx 
db.students.find({ year: { $in: [2, 3] } });
```
## Task 12: Delete a student by roll number

- Delete a student from the database using their roll number.

```jsx 
db.students.deleteOne({ rollNumber: 3 });
```

## Task 13: Delete all students from a department

- Delete all students who belong to the Electrical Engineering department.
```jsx 
db.students.deleteMany({ department: "Electrical Engineering" });
```
## Task 14: Retrieve all topics for a subject
- Query the MongoDB subject and retrieve all topics listed for it.
```jsx 
  db.subjects.find(
  { name: "MongoDB" },
  { topics: 1, _id: 0 }
);
```

## Task 15: Count the number of subjects in which a student is enrolled
-Write a query that returns the number of subjects each student is enrolled in.
```jsx
db.students.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      name: 1,
      subjectCount: { $size: "$subjectsEnrolled" }
    }
  }
]);
```
